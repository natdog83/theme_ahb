						<h2>Artisan crafted beer with locally sourced ingredients whenever possible.</h2>
                        <p>At Angry Horse we work hard to brew the <strong>best beer possible</strong>, utilizing quality ingredients <strong>time tested methods</strong> overseen by our brewers to level that borders on OCD.  This artisanal approach to brewing provides the results so you know your glass will be amazing.</p>
                        <p>To obtain the <strong>best ingredients</strong> we purchase and locally source as much as we can.  This means that we can see, smell, and taste ingredients before the yeast does its magic and turns them into beer.  In order to make the best beer we can, we believe in working with local farmers to build the <strong>local supply chain</strong> for quality ingredients and to provide jobs.</p>
                        <p>Weâ€™re excited to continue growing the LA beer movement, where some of the best beer, from some of the best breweries in the US is being made.</p>
